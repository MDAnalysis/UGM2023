# Presentation Materials
All presenters at the [MDAnalysis UGM](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/ugm2023/) are encouraged (but not required) to make their presentations publicly available by depositing their presentation materials (e.g., slides, notebooks, data, etc.) in the [presentation_materials](./presentation_materials) directory. 

## How to Submit Materials
First things first: If you don't already have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, make one now (it's free!). This will allow you to work collaboratively with others, and you'll need one to contribute to this repo and the main MDAnalysis codebase. The MDAnalysis User Guide has lots of resources on [how to contribute](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/contributing.html) using GitHub and [how to get started with GitHub and Git](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/contributing.html#version-control-git-and-github).

### Set up a folder for your materials
After [forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [MDAnalysis/UGM2023](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/UGM2023) repository, you can set up your own folder (named `yourlastname_yourfirstname`) in the [presentation_materials](./presentation_materials) directory from a [web browser](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/22534), using the [command line](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository), or using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Use the [README template](./template-README.md) to add a `README.md` file to your folder that includes, at a minimum, your name, the title of your talk, and a list of the materials that you are sharing.

### Submit materials by creating a PR
Once you have deposited all of your presentation materials locally (please note that PDF is the preferred format for sharing presentation slides), you can submit them to the [MDAnalysis/UGM2023](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/UGM2023) repo by creating a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (PR). Your PR is then sent to the repo maintainers, who will ensure everything looks okay. You may receive questions or comments in your PR; once any necessary changes are approved, voilà - your presentation will be able to be referenced by many others!
