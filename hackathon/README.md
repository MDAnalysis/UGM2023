# Hackathon

As part of the [MDA
UGM2023](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/ugm2023/) we are holding a
*hackathon* for anybody interested in working with a number of
MDAnalysis core developers on code --- it can be your own project
where you want some help or start building something amazing with a
few like-minded hackers!

* time: 9:30 -- 15:00 (WEST)

## What should I work on?

The hackathon will give you the opportunity to ask experts for advice
and team up with other like-minded people to solve problems. We
encourage you to bring your own code along, but we also have two
additional focus areas where you can get involved in some current
problems of interest to the wider MDAnalysis community.

### Bring your own problem

If you are working on your code where you use MDAnalysis and you want
to discuss it or need some help or ideas: then bring it and chat with
some of the core developers or other users. 

### Contribute to MDAnalysis!

We are always looking for new contributions to the 
[MDAnalysis](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis) library. Why
not spend this hackathon fixing one of our many issues or maybe
even contributing a fun new enhancement?

This session is particularly geared towards individuals who might not
have previous experiences contributing to open-source projects, and
dealing with the peculiarities of [Github](https://github.com/).

For more details, go to the [fix_an_issue](./fix_an_issue) directory.

### Build an MDAKit

[MDAKits](https://www.mdanalysis.org/2022/08/24/mdakits-intro/) are
standalone packages containing code using MDAnalysis components. They
are installed as a separate package from MDAnalysis. An MDAKit can be
written by anyone and hosted anywhere.

**We built tools to easily package *your code* into Python packages
that users can just install and use alongside MDAnalysis.** In this
session you can **learn how to package and organize your code to reach
a wider audience** (or just make it easier for your collaborators and
team mates to work with your code).

For more details, go to the [mdakits](./mdakits) directory.


### MDAnalysis and Blender

The [Molecular
Nodes](https://bradyajohnston.github.io/MolecularNodes/) plugin (by
@BradyAJohnston) for the 3D animation and rendering program
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) makes it possible to do highly
professional renderings of MD trajectories. Under the hood, *Molecular
Nodes* uses MDAnalysis for trajectory I/O. 

For more details, go to the [blender](./blender) directory.
