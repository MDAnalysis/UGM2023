to choose from. You are welcome to leave for (and return from) lunch 
at any time; the listed hours are to indicate what times members 
of the MDAnalysis team will be on hand to help you with any 
questions. 

Coffee and tea *will* be provided. 



## How do I participate?
### Before the hackathon
 - Read the hackathon materials, and read/watch any of the linked
   resources you're not already familiar with.
   
 - If you don't already have a GitHub account, make one now! This
   will allow you to work collaboratively with others, and you'll need
   one to contribute to the main MDAnalysis codebase.
 - Join the [discord][] to follow the discussion on the
   [#hackathon channel][hackathon-channel]!
 - Look through the [ideas below](#What-should-I-work-on?), and start
   to think how you'd like use your time during the hackathon to
   contribute to MDAnalysis.
   - If you have a specific project of your own in mind: raise an issue
     on the [UGM Issue Tracker][issue-tracker] so that you have a
     dedicated place share and discuss your idea and gather other
     attendees to help you. Also share your idea (with a link to the
     issue) on the [#hackathon channel][hackathon-channel].
   - If you see an existing idea (from the MDAnalysis team or another
     attendee) that interests you, find the associated issue and join
     the discussion there. Even if you don't intend to work on an
     issue yourself (or are yet undecided), any questions, comments
     and thoughts are always useful.
   - If you have suggestions or complaints about MDAnalysis code
     or documentation, consider raising an issue on the
     [MDAnalysis issue tracker](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues)
     or the [User Guide issue tracker](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/UserGuide/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=user_stories.md&title=)!
     The User Guide has an issue template called "User stories"
     that follows this template:
     **As a *type of user*, I *want to achieve this goal*,
     so that *reason why*.**
     
     If there is anything you wanted to do with your simulation
     and couldn't figure out (easily) how, please leave us a story there
     so we can improve our docs! We definitely also appreciate
     contributions to our documentation as well if you have an idea
     what you would like to see!

### At the hackathon
 - **Pick an idea and gather a team!** Use the associated issues (see
   below) to find others who expressed interest in a particular project.
   You can also team up with others to tackle multiple smaller issues
   together.
   
   While you can choose to work individually, we strongly encourage you
   to make use of this opportunity to work alongside like-minded
   attendees this will both make the experience more fun, and improve
   your code's quality.
   - *Working on a project as a team:* Discuss how you could split your
     project into different tasks. Make a central repository for your
     code on GitHub, and use issues to keep track of and assign
     developers to these tasks. Use Pull Requests (and push
     frequently!) to share your progress with your team and allow them
     to review or comment - and in turn, review and comment on your
     teammates' progress. Eventually, these PRs can be merged to
     combine everyone's work into a greater whole.
     
 - Update progress on the associated UGM issue (if one doesn't exist
   yet, make one now) to let other attendees and the MDAnalysis team
   know how you're going!
 - Continue to use the [#hackathon][hackathon-channel] discord channel
   for any broader discussion, and remember the MDAnalysis team is
   on hand to help you out!
 - Hack away, make new friends, build something awesome - and have fun!

#### Showcase
At the end of the session, we will be holding a brief showcase to allow
those who wish to share the work they achieved over the hackathon. 

This could be advertising a new feature you created or showing off a 
bug fix you're particularly proud of; and need not be a "finished" 
product - you can talk about what you got done, what future plans 
are, and if there's still help wanted.

If you do wish to share, add a slide for you/your team to the 
shared presentation. We have a
[Google Slides template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nezBx545EJlKI2_JRlTIz1L7PO7cdeLOYCcUzi4TsEc/edit#slide=id.g1e811d8524a_0_0),
also available as a PDF ([./ShowcaseTemplate.pdf](ShowcaseTemplate.pdf)).
Please submit as in **PDF format** for portability by
using [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc80buxTloXq817K3_y5oSUWF1Hs6V8ngjnW3BNmWze7oBK1A/viewform?usp=sf_link).
Depending how many wish to present, time may be short, so have 
an elevator pitch summary for your work ready!

### After the hackathon
It's very possible that you won't "finish" a project within the 
timelimit of the hackathon - and that's ok! Stay in contact with your
team on GitHub or Discord - we strongly encourage you to keep working 
on your project.

No code project is ever truly "finished", and we hope that you'll 
stick around - whether this is maintaining and improving your new 
contribution, or finding other ways to contribute the broader 
MDAnalysis ecosystem. We're always looking for more help!


## What should I work on?

The hackathon will give you the opportunity to ask experts for advice
and team up with other like-minded people to solve problems. We
encourage you to bring your own code along, but we also have two
additional focus areas where you can get involved in some current
problems of interest to the wider MDAnalysis community.

### Bring your own problem

If you are working on your code where you use MDAnalysis and you want
to discuss it or need some help or ideas: then bring it and chat with
some of the core developers or other users. 

Raise an issue on the [UGM Issue Tracker][issue-tracker]; include 
`[project]` at the start of the issue title, and share a link to the
issue on the [#hackathon][hackathon-channel] discord channel to direct
discussion there.

### Contribute to MDAnalysis!

We are always looking for new contributions to the 
[MDAnalysis](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis) library. Why
not spend this hackathon fixing one of our many issues or maybe
even contributing a fun new enhancement?

This session is particularly geared towards individuals who might not
have previous experiences contributing to open-source projects, and
dealing with the peculiarities of [Github](https://github.com/).

For more details, go to the [fix-an-issue](./fix-an-issue) directory.

### Build an MDAKit

[MDAKits](https://www.mdanalysis.org/2022/08/24/mdakits-intro/) are
standalone packages containing code using MDAnalysis components. They
are installed as a separate package from MDAnalysis. An MDAKit can be
written by anyone and hosted anywhere.

**We built tools to easily package *your code* into Python packages
that users can just install and use alongside MDAnalysis.** In this
session you can **learn how to package and organize your code to reach
a wider audience** (or just make it easier for your collaborators and
team mates to work with your code).

For more details, go to the [mdakits](./mdakits) directory.


### MDAnalysis and Blender

The [Molecular
Nodes](https://bradyajohnston.github.io/MolecularNodes/) plugin (by
@BradyAJohnston) for the 3D animation and rendering program
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) makes it possible to do highly
professional renderings of MD trajectories. Under the hood, *Molecular
Nodes* uses MDAnalysis for trajectory I/O. 

For more details, go to the [blender](./blender) directory.
