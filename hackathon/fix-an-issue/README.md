# Fixing an issue in the MDAnalysis core library

With over [400 issues to deal with](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues)
we are always looking for new and old contributors to help enhance
and maintain the [MDAnalysis core library](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis).


## Team

The MDAnalysis core developers team (@IAlibay, @lilyminium, @fiona-nauthon,
@orbeckst, @richardjgowers, @micaela-matta) will help you along your way
towards contributing a code change to MDAnalysis


## Getting started

In order to contribute to MDAnalysis, you will need to set up a
development environment, make a fork of the MDAnalysis codebase
and then contribute the code back using a [Pull Request]().

Our [User Guide]() has a handy [contributors guide]() which you can
follow for all the information you need to achieve this. Feel free
to ask any members of the team for help if you encounter any issues
gettting started.


## Choose an issue

We have plenty of issues available for you to work on in our
[Issue Tracker](). For first time contributors, we encourage
you to look at our list of [easy bugs]() to fix. Have a chat with us,
to see which one would suit you best! When you found something, please
let us know in the issue that you are working on it so that other
attendees do not work on the same thing!

Our recommended pick is the [doctest MEGA-issue]() which involves
fixing our documentation so that code examples are self-contained
and should run on their own if you tried them out! Here multiple
attendees can work on this issue, just let us know which files you
are planning to work on.
